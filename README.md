- Conduct a [Market Performance vs Target](https://github.com/Midoford/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Marekt_Performance_vs_Target.pdf): Comparing actual market performance against set sales targets to evaluate effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.

**Purpose of Sales Analytics:**
- To empower businesses to monitor and evaluate their sales activities and performance.

**Importance of Analyzing Sales Data:**
- Identifying sales patterns and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) to guide strategic decisions.

**Role of Reports:**

**1.** Determine effective customer discount strategies.

**2.** Facilitate negotiations with consumers.

**3.** Identify potential opportunities for business expansion into promising markets.

### Key Findings and Insights
- Financial Performance: The company saw explosive growth from 2019 to 2021, with sales increasing from $87.48M to $598.88M. This represents a 304.48% increase in a single year (2020-2021).
- Market Performance vs. Target: Despite the massive growth, the company missed its 2021 target by 9.2%, a deficit of $54.94M.
- Underperforming Markets: Several countries were key contributors to the missed target, with Poland (-18.1%), Canada (-14.5%), and Spain (-14.1%) showing the largest negative variances.
- Top Contributing Customers: Amazon ($82.09M) and Euronics ($30.56M) were the top-performing customers in 2021.
- High-Growth Customers: Customers like Novus and Boulanger experienced explosive growth, increasing their sales by over 400% from the previous year.

### Recommendations
- Focus on Underperforming Markets: Conduct a detailed analysis of countries like Poland, Canada, and Spain to determine the reasons for their low performance. Adjust sales strategies, marketing efforts, or re-evaluate targets in these regions.
- Engage with Top Customers: Maintain and strengthen relationships with top contributors like Amazon, Euronics, and Walmart. Explore opportunities for tailored promotions or new partnerships.
- Investigate High-Growth Customers: Analyze the strategies that led to the success of customers like Novus and Boulanger to see if these models can be applied to other customers or markets.

### Conclusion
The business has shown remarkable growth, demonstrating strong market presence. However, the missed 2021 target highlights a need to address significant underperformance in key markets. By rectifying these issues and leveraging insights from top-performing customers and high-growth areas, the company can both sustain its growth and exceed future sales targets.

## Finance Report
**Project Objectives:**
- Create [Profit and Loss (P&L) Reports by Fiscal Year](https://github.com/Midoford/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/P%26L_by_Year.pdf) & [Profit and Loss (P&L) Reports by  Months](https://github.com/Midoford/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/P%26L_by_Month.pdf): Provide detailed financial insights over different time periods to understand seasonal trends and annual performance.
- Create [Profit and Loss (P&L) Reports by Markets](https://github.com/Midoford/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/P%26L_by_Market.pdf): Analyze financial performance across various markets to see where the company stands in different regions.

**Purpose of Financial Analytics:**
- Evaluate financial performance, support decision-making, and facilitate communication with stakeholders.

**Importance of Analyzing Finance Data:**
- Aids in benchmarking against industry peers and previous periods, providing a foundation for budgeting and forecasting.

**Role of Reports:**

**1.** Align financial planning with strategic business goals.

**2.** Instill confidence in the organization's financial outlook among investors and management.

### Key Findings and Insights
- Financial Performance: The company saw explosive growth from 2019 to 2021, with net sales increasing from $87M to $599M. This represents a 304.48% increase in a single year (2020-2021). Gross Margin also saw a healthy increase of 297.55% in the same period.
- Market Performance: Despite the massive growth, the company's Gross Margin Percentage (GM%) has declined year-over-year, from 41.43% in 2019 to 36.43% in 2021.
- Country Performance: India ($161M) and the USA ($88M) are the top-performing markets in terms of Net Sales for 2021. New Zealand and China have the highest Gross Margin Percentages, at 48.23% and 41.07% respectively.
- Quarterly Performance: The highest-performing quarter in terms of Net Sales was Q2 at $119M, followed by Q4 at $88M. The Gross Margin Percentage remained relatively stable across all quarters, with an overall average of 37.11%.

### Recommendations
- Address Declining GM%: Investigate the reasons for the year-over-year decline in the Gross Margin Percentage. This could be due to increasing costs of goods sold (COGS), which have grown at a slightly faster rate than net sales. Identify opportunities to reduce costs or increase prices to improve profitability.
- Focus on High-Margin Markets: While India and the USA are the largest contributors to sales, it is recommended to analyze the strategies in high-margin countries like New Zealand and China to see if their success can be replicated elsewhere.
- Leverage Quarterly Insights: Analyze the strong performance in Q2 to understand the key factors contributing to the high sales volume. Use these insights to boost sales in other quarters.

### Conclusion
The business has shown remarkable growth in net sales, demonstrating a strong and expanding market presence. However, this growth has come at the expense of profitability, as indicated by the declining Gross Margin Percentage. To ensure sustained and profitable growth, the company must focus on improving its Gross Margin, particularly by addressing the rising COGS and learning from the successful strategies of its high-margin markets.
